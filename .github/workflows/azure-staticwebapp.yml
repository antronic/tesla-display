# This workflow will build and push a web application to an Azure Static Web App when you change your code.
#
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target Azure Static Web App.
# For instructions see https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/get-started-portal?tabs=vanilla-javascript
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Set up a secret in your repository named AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN with the value of your Static Web Apps deployment token.
#    For instructions on obtaining the deployment token see: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/deployment-token-management
#
# 3. Change the values for the APP_LOCATION, API_LOCATION and APP_ARTIFACT_LOCATION, AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN environment variables (below).
#    For instructions on setting up the appropriate configuration values go to https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/front-end-frameworks
